# week 6
- Improving jsonUtilities.py 
    + string stored as log(hashlib.md5(String))
    + caught pattern  matching issues with "111.0" and "1e70" that caused NaN, Inf or to big value for float32
- Learned how to use scaling, map and lambda functions
- Created more python notebooks to document preparation of data (scaling, correlated and non-variated values detection)
